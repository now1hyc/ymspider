  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://master:8888/hbase</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default HBase writes
    into /tmp.  Change this configuration else all data will be lost
    on machine restart.

<property>
    <name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>hdfs://master:8888/tmp</value>
    <description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
    Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
    than '/tmp' (The '/tmp' directory is often cleared on
    machine restart).

<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>master,slave1,centos3</value>
    <!--<value>centos3</value>-->
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
